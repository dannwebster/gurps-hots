# Characters: Important Considerations

## Introduction

Regardless of character point allocation, Template, or Tradition, there are some
important considerations when creating characters for this campaign.

## Supernatural Awareness
Some level of awareness of the Supernatural is a must. At the very least,
characters should have **Hidden Lore (One Sphere)** or **Hidden Lore (Spheres)**
at at least [1] level. Most characters should be actual supernatural participants,
and should dedicate a significant number of points to supernatural abilities,
contacts, and skills.

See [Advantages, Disadvantages, and Skills](Traits.md), Will and Will
Points, Methods of Magic, Ritual Magicians, and Attunements for ideas on where
to spend those points.

## Everyman Skills

Regardless of background, an effective GURPS adventurer should have these 6 skills at 12+.

1. Acting
1. Detect Lies
1. Fast Talk
1. Stealth
1. Swimming
1. Throwing

Missing any one of these skills can make certain _routine_ adventuring situations unnecessarily complex,
and slow the story without adding fun or drama.

The exception to this rule _not_ having that skill is core to the character. For example,
a Thassalophobic character that doesn't have swimming, or a Shy character without Acting or Fast Talk.

In cases such as these, when the character enters situations where that skill is called for, the _player_ should use that
as a situation to drive role playing and character growth.

## Survivability

How does your character survive when things get violent?
GURPS combat can be deadly, so it is important to consider how your character
will get back in the game if they get beaten, stabbed, or even shot. Some options:

* High DR, HP, or HT provided through Attunements
* Healing through Ritual Magic
* Supernatural protection that makes getting hit very unlikely
* Supernatural Durability from being an supernatural creature

## Combat Participation

* Not every character needs to be a combat monster, but since this is an
RPG, there will be fights. Given that, you will want your character to be
able to do something during them so that you, the player, don’t get bored.
Most PCs should have at least 2 points in a skill from each of the following groups:

* A Guns skill
* A melee weapon skill
* An unarmed combat skill

You can get very creative to justify _why_ your character has these skills that may not
come from ordinary combat training. Examples:

- Wrestling: I grew up on a farm, and had to wrestle my brothers... and the steers for branding
- Rifle: I hunted squirrels to feed my family
- Knife: My father was a butcher


## Social Efficacy

It’s not going to be all shooting and fighting, either.
Much, if not most of the game will revolve around social interaction with NPCs.
Most of the Social Skills listed under the Smooth Operator Talent (B91) are
likely to be important (probably not Panhandling).
