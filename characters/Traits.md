#Characters: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Skills

## Introduction

In addition to Attunements, here are some advantages and disadvantages that are extremely
relevant to this campaign.

## Characteristics

### New Secondary Characteristic: Will Points (WP) [2 points per 1 WP]
A character’s Will Points (WP) characteristic is equal to IQ + Will + Will Points. Characters cannot by more than 1/3 Will (rounded up) in extra Will Points. See Will and Will Points for more information.

### Detect

Most Harmonizers have some form of the Detect advantage that makes them aware of other entities tapping into the Spheres.

Start with Detect based on the commoness of the Sphere or Spheres detected:

Classes of Sphere Detection are:

* All Spheres: (Common) [20]
* Higher Spheres Spheres: (Semi-Common) [15]: Psychic, Ethereal, Celestial
* Lower Spheres: (Semi-Common) [15]: Corporeal, Empathic, Empyreal, Infernal
* Limnal Spheres: (Semi-Common) [15]: Zoetic, Sylvan, Material
* Extra-Planar Spheres: (Occasional) [10]: Celestial, Infernal
* Technical Spheres: (Occasional) [10]: Corporeal, Empyreal
* One Sphere: (Rare) [5]

Modifying it with a (-10%) for being part of the Sphere power.

Most Sphere users have the Vague (-50%) Limitation. Only a Very few have the Precise (+100%) Enhancement

#### Acute Detect

At [2] points / level, you can buy additional Acute Detect.
This applies to all rolls to analyze or perceive using Detect, much like Acute Vision or Acute Hearing applies to those senses.

### Supernatural Advantages
As a general rule, any “Supernatural” advantage in the Basic Set (one with a Lightning Bolt icon),
is acceptable with the exception of those related to multiple timelines and alternate dimensions
(So, no Jumper, Warp, Unique, etc). Supernatural Advantages are covered in detail under the [Powers](./Powers.md) section.


### Social Advantages/Disadvantages
Additionally, many mundane Social Advantages may be modified to include a Spiritual component:

* Reputation (Spirits)
* Favor (From a Spirit)
* Contact (Spirit) : A spirit you can routinely contact for information of a given type (often Hidden Lore: Spirits)
* Spirit Ally
* Spirit Patron
* Claim to Hospitality (Spirits)
* Enemy Spirit
* Spirit Dependency

## New Advantages

### Spheric Harmony [10pts/Sphere]
Your character has a Harmony with one of the 10 Spheres. Each Harmony gives access to the powers associated with that
sphere.

### Attunements [Variable]
Attunements represent intrinsic capabilities to channel Spritis and Will to immediately enhance physical capabilities.
See [Attunements](./Attunements.md) for more details.

### Perk: True Name [1]
You know the True Name of one Entity (Spiritual, Human, Animal, etc). You must specify the exact Entity at the time of character creation. This gives a +4 to perform rituals where that Entity is the subject of the casting, OR where that entity can provide significant assistance in the ritual (GMs discression). You can take this more than once, and you can choose to know your own True Name.

### Perk: Relaxation Drill [1]
A Relaxation Drill is a short, personal ritual a character can enact to regain 3 Will Points without a Will roll. This must be some mindless (though not necessarily useless) activity that the character must be able to immerse his or herself in completely for an uninterrupted 30 minutes. A character can only regain Will points using a Relaxation Drill once per day (though they can do the activity as often as possible).

The nature of the Relaxation Drill must be specified completely at character creation time, and cannot be altered. The activity itself might be physically strenuous, but must conceivably be something someone could do to relax and rejuvenate mentally.

Some Examples:

* **Relaxation Drill (3 Mile Hike)** – Character must hike at least 3 miles on a familiar route
* **Relaxation Drill (Shooting Practice)** – Character fires 50 rounds at a stationary target in controlled circumstances
* **Relaxation Drill (Painting)** – Character paints on canvas
* **Relaxation Drill (Commune with Nature)** – Character watches the Sunset, Listens to a brook, etc. Requires unobstructed view of natural surroundings
* **Relaxation Drill (Read the Bible)** – Catch up on your verses

The GM can rule that certain circumstances do not allow an activity to count as a Relaxation Drill. For example, running 3 miles from a pursuing enemy would not fulfill Relaxation Drill (3 Mile Run). Other circumstances might result in a decreased Will Point recovery: running in an unfamiliar area might result in only 2 Will Point recovered.


### Mentally Fit [5]
Your regain WP at twice the normal rate (1 WP per 30 minutes mental rest). You have +1 on all Will rolls to regain lost WP. Mentally Fit also gives +1 bonus on Meditation and Esoteric Meditation skill rolls. There is no “Very Mentally Fit.”


## Skills

### New Skills

#### New Skill: Esoteric Meditation
* Will/Very Hard
* Defaults: None
* Prerequisites: Meditation. Cannot exceed Meditation skill level

Use this skill instead of Meditation to regain lost WP very quickly. Concentrate for (20-skill) seconds (minimum 1 second), then roll vs skill. On a success, you enter a trancelike state which you can retain for hours. In addition to the effects of Meditation described on B207, you regain WP at a rate of 1 WP per (20-skill) seconds while in this trance, up to your Margin of Success +1 WP. On a Critical success, you regain all lost WP after the first interval.

Esoteric Meditation is not susceptible to the -2/-5/-10 against Will rolls for low WP.

If something might interrupt your Esoteric Meditation (loud noise, etc), you may make an Esoteric Meditation roll to maintain the trance, but there are no minuses for the intensity of the interruption. Esoteric Mediation is powerful enough that highly skilled practitioners can trance to regain WP during combat.

### Existing Skills

#### Symbol Drawing
* IQ/Hard

This skill can add to the ability to cast a Ritual. Before performing a ritual, draw for 1d minutes, then roll against Symbol Drawing. Add 1/2 your margin of success to your Ritual roll. -1 or more for improvised drawing materials.


#### Autohypnosis (B179)
* Will/Hard
* Defalt: Meditation-4

This skill is exactly as it is described on B179. However, it is important to note that the +2 to Will can be used to increase the ability to succeed with a Will roll to gain WP, and the +2 to Concentration can be used improve ability with Meditation or Esoteric Meditation.


#### Hidden Lore (Spiritual Mechanics)
* IQ/Average
* Prerequisite: Unusual Background (Spiritual Mechanics) [5]

This is a practical knowledge of how the spirit world really works. Most Traditions know some aspect of this information, but this is the unfiltered truth. This is a very rare skill, and requires Unusual Background (Spiritual Mechanics) [5] to learn.


#### Spiritual Physics
* IQ/Very Hard
* Prerequisite: Unusual Background (Spiritual Mechanics) [5], Physics, Mathematics, and Hidden Lore (Spiritual Mechanics). Cannot exceed prerequisite skill levels

This is a mathematical, scientific understanding of how the spirit world really works. It can be used to design devices that interact with the spirit world (such as ghost detectors and the like), build mathematical models of magical phenomena, etc. This skill is extremely rare.


#### Hidden Lore (Specific Spheres)
* IQ/Average

The details, history, politics, procedures, organization, and prominent members of a given Tradition. This is represents mundane information; the esoteric knowledge of the Tradition’s philosophy is represented by the Ritual Magic skill. This skill is usually only available to a member of that Tradition, but generally counts against SSP (see Methods of Magic). Example: Hidden Lore (Voudon).

Hidden Lore (Specific Tradition) and Hidden Lore (Traditions) default to each other at -4.


#### Hidden Lore (Spheres)
* IQ/Average

This gives general knowledge of the world of the Traditions, including names of prominent Traditions and general information about them. Hidden Lore (Specific Tradition) and Hidden Lore (Traditions) default to each other at -4.


#### Dreaming (B188)
* Will/Hard
* Defaults: Will-6

Many Rituals target victims through their dreams. In addition to the effects listed on B188, the Dreaming skill can substitute for Will in any resistance against dream-based attacks. Additionally, a successful Dreaming roll can allow a sleeper to regain one extra Will Point per hour of sleep.


#### Meditation (B207)
* Will/Hard
* Defaults: Will-6 or Autohypnosis-4

Use this skill to regain lost WP quickly. . Concentrate for (20-skill) seconds (minimum 1 second), then roll vs skill. On a success, you enter a trancelike state which you can retain for hours. In addition to the effects of Meditation described on B207, you regain WP at double your normal rate (30 min per WP, or 15 min per WP with Mentally Fit) while in this trance, up to your Margin of Success +1 WP. On a Critical success, you regain all lost WP after the first interval.

Meditation is not susceptible to the -2/-5/-10 against Will rolls for low WP.

If something might interrupt your Meditation (loud noise, etc), you may make a Meditation roll to maintain the trance (at appropriate minuses for the intensity of the interruption).
