# Characters: Archetypes

## Introduction

Character Archteypes, Nature, and Demeanor are concepts taken from White Wolf's _World of Darkness_ games. While
these terms have no mechanical representation in GURPS terms, they can be helpful in guiding player choices.

## Nature and Demeanor
Nature and Demeanor, are two non-mechanical Traits based on a list of Archetypes (see below).
These traits can help players understand their characters' personalities, and help chose other Traits
(Advantages, Disadvantages, and Quirks) which define the character. Also, if the player gets overwhelmed
by how to address a specific game situation in character ("Does Bloodlust or Sense of Duty matter more here?"),
Nature and Demeanor can help center the player, and guide them to an in-character choise.

# Demeanor
Demeanor is the way a character presents herself to
the outside world. It is the “mask” she wears to protect
her inner self. A character’s Demeanor often differs
from her Nature, though it might not. Also, Demeanor
refers to the attitude a character adopts most often —
people change Demeanors as often as they change their
minds. Demeanor has no effect on any rules.

# Nature
Nature is the character’s “real” self, the person she
truly is. The Archetype a player chooses reflects that
character’s deep-rooted feelings about herself, others,
and the world. Nature should not be the only aspect of
a character’s true personality, merely the most dominant.
