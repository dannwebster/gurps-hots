# Characters: Attunements

## Introduction
Attunments are the capability to modify a Trait or gain an ability by using Sphere Harmonies and
Will Power. Though Attunements fundamentally affect the body, and thus are Corporeal in nature, limited amounts of
Attunements can be granted by any Sphere Harmony (with proper justification). Since they are fundamentally
Corporeal in nature, the Corporeal sphere grants unlimited access to Attunements.

## Limitations
All Attunments start at -40% modifier have the following modifiers:

* **Sphere Power -10%**: Can be cut off, has sphere based Emanation
* **Costs Energy (Modeled on Costs Fatigue) -10%**: All Attunements cost 2 WP per level per minute to use. Maintaining them costs 1 additional point per level after the first minute
* **Requires Will Roll -5%** : Each use of an Attunement requires a Will roll to activate
* **Takes Extra Time -10%** : Each use of an Attunement takes a 1 second Concentrate Maneuver
* **Limited by Harmonies -5%**: Can only have 12*(Number of Harmonies) Total Points of Attuntements OR Unlimited for Corporeal Harmony

Characters can further limit their Attunements as befits their particular origin.
Spiritual characters will typically have Pact and Temporary Limitations, while
Rogue Elements might have Uncontrollable or Emergencies Only.

## Examples

### Attunement: React (Basic Speed) [3 / Level]
+0.25 Speed [5] @ -40% = [3]

### Attunement: Accelerate (Basic Move) [3 / Level]
+1yd/sec [5] @ -40% = [3]

### Attunement: Withstand (DR) [3 / Level]
+3 DR [15] @ -40% (Tough Skin) + -40% = [3]

### Attunement: Survive (HP) [6 / Level]
+5 HP [10] @ -40% = [6]

**Note**: when this wears off, you lose all of the HP against your normal HP score.
This can result in a characterâ€™s instant death after it wears off.

### Attunement: Finesse (DX) [12 / Level]
+1 DX [20] @ -40% = [12]

### Attunement: Perceive (Per) [3 / Level]
+1 Per [5] @ -40% = [3]

### Attunement: Overpower (ST) [6 / Level]
+1 ST [10] @ -40% = [6]
