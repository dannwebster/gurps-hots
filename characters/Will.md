# Characters: Will and Will Points

## Game Mechanics
Will is perhaps the most important characteristic for a Sphere Mage.

In this game, characters do not spend Fatigue to power abilities and Ritual Spells.
Instead, they spend Will Points.

A character starts the game with Will Points equal to their Will attribute
(IQ + Will). Through specialized training, characters can gain
additional Will points to extend their ability to power spells.

## Losing Will Points
In addition to expenditure of WP to power spells and abilities, there are
many supernatural and mundane effects that will cause characters to lose
Will. Anything in the Basic Set that has a character losing Fatigue due to
mental strain will drain Will Points instead of Fatigue Points.
Intoxication, torture, sleep deprivation, and mental trauma will cause loss of WP.
In addition to their other effects, Fright Checks will cost
Will Points equal to the margin of failure. Additionally, characters may lose
will for going against their character’s nature, chosing the “wrong” side of a
moral dilemma, etc.

## Effects of Lost Will
Low WP leads to susceptibility to both mundane suggestibility and supernatural
interference. This is modeled as pentalties to Will rolls and Self Control rolls,
as shown in the following table:

| Remaining Will | Will Penalty | Self Control Rolls | Supernatural |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------|
|Less than 1/2 your Will Points remaining	| -2 	 | Self Controls are unmodified	| None |
|Less than 1/3 your Will Points remaining	| -5	 | Self Controls are one degree harder (15 becomes 12, 12 becomes 9, 9 becomes 6, 6 automatically fails) | Mild supernatural interference |
|0 WP remaining	| -7	| All Self Control Rolls automatically fail. | Major Supernatural Interference |
|-1 x WP	| -10	| Any disadvantage requiring a Self Control becomes a Compulsion (Alchoholics compulsively seek to get drunk, etc) | Constant Supernatural Assault |

The excessive minuses associated with Will rolls are likely to lead to critical failures, which may have drastic consequences.

## Regaining Lost Will
Will Points are regained at the level of 1 per hour of mental rest with a successful Will roll. Note, that this Will roll IS at -2/-5/-7/-10
for loss of Will Points. Thus, characters who are mentally fatigued find it much
harder to recover. Note, this is MUCH slower than 1 FP recovered per 10 minutes
rest.

A critical success on the recovery Will roll regains 1/2 all lost WP, rounded up.

Sleep counts as mental rest, but all Will rolls are automatic successes.
Thus, a full night of sleep allows a character to regain 8 Will Points.
Esoteric Meditation, Ritual Magic, and the Mentally Fit advantage can
help with this (See Below).
